# Inery Incentivized Testnet - Node Setup

Official Documentation:

>- [Validator setup instructions](https://docs.inery.io/docs/lite-and-master-nodes-1/)
>- [Official Website](https://inery.io/)

Explorer:
>-  https://explorer.inery.io/blocks/

>- To monitor and get alerted about your validator health status you can use my guide on [Set up monitoring and alerting for inery validator](https://github.com/nodesxploit/testnet/blob/main/inery/monitoring/README.md)

### =================================

## Hardware Requirements [Lite Nodes]

- 4 VCPU
- 8 GB RAM
- 500 GB SSD 
- Connection 100 Mbit/s port

## Hardware Requirements [Master Nodes]

- 16 VCPU
- 64 GB RAM 
- 2 x 1 TB NVMe SSD 
- Connection 1 Gbit/s port

Note : Make sure you're ordering vps as specs needed for the requirement, otherwise the nodes may unstable and can't run the software/binary.

## Set up your inery node
### Option 1 (automatic)
You can setup your inery fullnode in few minutes by using automated script below. It will prompt you to input your validator node name!
```
wget -O inery.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodesxploit/testnet/main/inery/inery.sh && chmod +x inery.sh && ./inery.sh
```
### Option 2 (manual)
You can follow [manual guide](https://github.com/nodesxploit/testnet/blob/main/inery/manual_install.md) if you better prefer setting up node manually

## Setup
>- Register Inery Testnet Dashboard on https://testnet.inery.io/
Simply click Sign-Up and fill out the forms.

On contabo you can see your servername (DNS) on Reverse DNS Managamenet menu by logging in on your contabo panel


DNS use the PTR record from your contabo account (or you may ask google if using other provider).

IP Address use your server IP.

Account Name use any name you want (max 12 char).

Password use a secure password and don't lose it :)

After registering you'll see secret phrase backup, make sure you're back up your phrase!

 If you're deploying Master Nodes, make sure to claim 50.000 INR Test Token From Faucet. For Lite Nodes it's no need to claim the token.

also save all data from left side, Account Name, Server Name, Server IP, Public Key, Private Key.

## Post Installation
Edit the configuration
```
sudo nano tools/config.json
```

## CHOOSE BETWEEN LITE / MASTER NODES BASED ON YOUR SPECS
### For Lite Nodes
find "LITE_NODE" and replace placeholder.
```
    "LITE_NODE" : {
        "PEER_ADDRESS" : "IP:9010",
        "HTTP_ADDRESS": "0.0.0.0:8888",
        "HOST_ADDRESS": "0.0.0.0:9010"
    },
```
**only change the PEER_ADDRESS data, IP:9010 should be YOURIP:9010 (keep the 9010 port), Save it (ctrl+S), Type "Y" and exit (ctrl+X).

Create New Screen
```
screen -S inery
```
Run Lite Nodes
```
 ./ine.py --lite
```
CTRL+A+D to exit screen.
```
cd ~/inery-node/inery.setup/lite.node
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## For Master Nodes
Scroll down to MASTER ACCOUNT and replace placeholders
```
"MASTER_ACCOUNT":
{
    "NAME": "AccountName",
    "PUBLIC_KEY": "PublicKey",
    "PRIVATE_KEY": "PrivateKey",
    "PEER_ADDRESS": "IP:9010",
    "HTTP_ADDRESS": "0.0.0.0:8888",
    "HOST_ADDRESS": "0.0.0.0:9010"
}
```
 
Make sure you change AccountName, PublicKey,PrivateKey and IP based on your Inery Testnet Dashboard. Save it (ctrl+S), Type "Y" and exit (ctrl+X)

Create New Screen
```
screen -S inery
```
Run Master Nodes
```
./ine.py --master
```
CTRL+A+D to exit screen.
```
cd ~/inery-node/inery.setup/master.node
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```
After everything is setup, you have to register and after approve it your account as producer


## ========= PLEASE SYNC FIRST BEFORE RUN THIS COMMAND BELOW ============

## Create Wallet
```
cd;  cline wallet create --file defaultWallet.txt
```
If your wallet has password, you need to unlock it first
```
cline wallet unlock --password YOUR_WALLET_PASSWORD
```
Import key 
```
cline wallet import --private-key MASTER_PRIVATE_KEY
```
change MASTER_PRIVATE_KEY with your privatekey on Dashboard.

Register as producer by executing command:
```
cline system regproducer ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY 0.0.0.0:9010
```
Approve your account as producer by executing command:
```
cline system makeprod approve ACCOUNT_NAME ACCOUNT_NAME
```
 

## Check Master Nodes Status 
Check on Inery Explorer https://explorer.inery.io/

Your master nodes should be seen produced blocks after your nodes synced.


Check Wallet balance using this command:
```
cline get currency balance inery.token ACCOUNT_NAME
```

## Usefull Command
For removing nodes (uninstall) go to `inery.setup/inery.node/` and execute `./stop.sh` script
To resume blockchain protocol execute `start.sh` script
To remove blockchain with all data from local machine go to `inery.setup/inery.node/` and execute `./clean.sh` script
